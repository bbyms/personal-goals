Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Learn more about Front-End
2. Write more
3. Focus on personal projects
4. Learn more about Open Source
